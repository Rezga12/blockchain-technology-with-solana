# Bonus 01: Finding An Exploit For Deployed Solana Program

##

Bonus grading will be a bit untraditional and a bit complied to decentralized standards.\
The main goal for each student will be to find an exploit to the existing and already deployed **solana** program on `devnet`. There will be several exploits and abusing an exploit will result in yielding some amount of `$GRADE` token. The total points student will receive from this bonus will be equal to the amount of tokens he's able to retrieve from the program.

Students will be given only the address of the program, there won't be any other instructions.

Of course if one student finds the exploit he might tell it to the others, so the amount of total `$GRADE` tokens will be common for every student. If one student exploits the bug and retrieves tokens, others will not be able to exploit the same bug again to retrieve more tokens, _(I.E the amount of total tokens will be limited)._

_All students who wish to participate in this project will have to submit their wallet addresses in the start of the semester. When the project deadline comes, random snapshot will be taken on all the $GRADE holders and the points will be distributed. Also students who found the exploits are not required to keep those tokens to themselves, they can distribute it within the class, that's more Decentralized way_ :smile:.
