### Overview Of The Sources

Nick Szabo published the paper explaining idea of smart contracts back in 1997
[The Idea of Smart Contracts](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html)
  
[CODE IS LAW? Smart Contracts Explained](https://youtu.be/pWGLtjG-F5c)

This topic will start by discussing ethereum and it's features. It's important because the idea of 
smart contracts are the same for all the blockchains that support it. As ethereum was first to introduce it
we will talk about it a bit.

While talking about defi we also have to explain the notion of a token, this topic doesn't cover technical details
but ideological ones. Also note differences between native blockchain currencies and tokens built on top of it.

We will also talk about proof of stake, underline it's advantages and disadvantages vs proof of work.
and show some examples of how it works.

#### Types of DeFi Protocols

* Lending / Borrowing
