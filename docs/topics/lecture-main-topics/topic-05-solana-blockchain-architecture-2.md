# Topic 08: Concept of Oracles and Layer 2 protocols

In previous section we talked about limitations of smart contracts. The oracles - third party trusted entities to aid enhancement of smart contract functionality were introduced for that matter.We will be talking about the most well known chain of oracles: **Chainlink.** also we will discuss the concept of layer 2 protocols _(through not in great detail)_ and discuss what are their benefits and how are they used. The most relevant example will be **Polygon** blockchain.

## Agenda

* The concept of oracles
  * The problems with traditional smart contracts
    * how to determine current gas price
    * determine current USD value of Ethereum
    * Determine the state of the weather
    * Flip a Coin (Heads / Tails)
    * make an API call to the external resource
  * How oracles work
  * Common use cases and examples of oracles
* **Chainlink**
  * The oracle problem and how chainlink solves it
    * Chainlink protocol: the standard for oracle networks
  * LINK token and how it is utilized
  * Chainlink features:
    * Data feeds
    * Chainlink functions
    * Automate Contracts
    * Verifiable Random functions
    * External API calls
* Examples of using Data Feeds
  * Example 1: assert function on sent value in USD
    * how to use Chainlink ETH/USD Price feed in a smart contract
  * Example 2: writing simple coin flip view function in a smart contract
    * how to use Chainlink VRFs
* Layer 2 protocols
  * The problems with ethereum
    * high transaction fees / gas price
    * low scallability
  * Polygon: Layer 2 for ethereum
    * how polygon functions
    * what are **rollups**
