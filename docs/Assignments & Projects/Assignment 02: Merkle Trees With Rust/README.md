### Assignment 02: Merkle Trees With Rust

In this project students will be required to implement a rust function to generate a Merkle proof.
Starter files will be provided in the `./src` folder.\

**Surface Level Description:**

The Assignment will require the implementation of a function `gen_merkle_proof()` which
generates a merkle proof for one leaf provided the merkle root represented
by a long list of strings. this function may take about 10 lines of code in python,
but in rust it might be a bit more challenging.\
students will have to get familiarized with already working `verifier.rs`
file to implement the needed function, even if they will not have to write
a bunch of code and use a lot of **Rust** functionality it will be a nice
practice to get familiar with the language. Also to get the grasp of how
**Merkle Trees** Work

The assignment starting source code will be similar to the one of Stanford,
but all the **Python** code will be rewritten on **Rust**. Also we might add
some additional functionality if an assignment comes too easy.
