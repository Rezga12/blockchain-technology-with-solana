### Assignment 08: Nft Renting Program
In this assignment students will be implementing nft renting program. References will be taken from **Token Manager**
program by [Cardinal Labs](https://www.cardinal.so/) (through it will be simplified to the state of core concepts). This assignment will be the most challenging because students are not
allowed to use `Anchor`. all project should be done by using native solana libraries. This one might even fit as the final
project and be allowed to work on in groups of 2 or 3.\
starting files will be located in `./src` folder

**Surface Level**\
If student is able to make token renting program work, he will understand anything on solana. this program requires decent knowledge 
of how solana programming model works, especially `SPL tokens`, and how is everything connected. _Will continue the description
when I go through all the cardinal code and understand how can I simplify the implementation for students._
