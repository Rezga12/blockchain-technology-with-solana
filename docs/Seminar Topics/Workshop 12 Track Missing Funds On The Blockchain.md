# Workshop 14: Track Missing Funds On The Blockchain

Well as you already know the user is in charge of their funds and he/she has all the responsibility to protect them. if something goes wrong there's no one who can return the lost funds. That's why the scamming is quite common in blockchain world, because it's impossible to take stolen funds from scammers and almost impossible to track them. In this workshop we will learn to scan through the transactions to track missing funds stolen by some kind of scammer or exploiter.

The students will be given a starting wallet from which the funds were stolen. and users should guess where are the funds located now. the funds will be consisted from solana, SPL tokens and NFTs so the result might be several wallets containing the funds.

Usually we are using [Solscan](https://solscan.io/?cluster=devnet) to track something like this but provided sandbox use case will be too large to look through them by hand. students have to use javascript libraries to finally come to the end goal.

More details and examples for this workshop will come _later_
